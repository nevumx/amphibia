Amphibia
=========

by Nicholaos Mouzourakis

Created with Unity 2019.4.34f1. Inspired by https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23. To play the game or mess around with it, download an appropriate Unity version, open the folder in Unity, (if asked to upgrade the Asset Database, you may click Yes) open the MainScene, click each Amphipod, and you can mess around with its type in the inspector, and the press the play button to play. Make sure your play window has enough width to accommodate the playfield.

Shrimp sprite is courtesy of ChickenTeddy. Thanks, ChickenTeddy! (Note that even though this software is licensed with the Unlicense into the public domain, the shrimp sprite's use is subject to ChickenTeddy's original license!)
